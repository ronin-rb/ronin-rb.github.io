Additional Definitions.<br/><br/>  As used herein, &quot;this License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser<br/>General Public License, and the &quot;GNU GPL&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU<br/>General Public License.<br/><br/>  &quot;The Library&quot; refers to a covered work governed by this License,<br/>other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.<br/><br/>  An &quot;Application&quot; is any work that makes use of an interface provided<br/>by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.<br/>Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode<br/>of using an interface provided by the Library.<br/><br/>  A &quot;Combined Work&quot; is a work produced by combining or linking an<br/>Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library<br/>with which the Combined Work was made is also called the &quot;Linked<br/>Version&quot;.<br/><br/>  The &quot;Minimal Corresponding Source&quot; for a Combined Work means the<br/>Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code<br/>for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are<br/>based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.<br/><br/>  The &quot;Corresponding Application Code&quot; for a Combined Work means the<br/>object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data<br/>and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the<br/>Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.<br/><br/>  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br/><br/>  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License<br/>without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.<br/><br/>  2. Conveying Modified Versions.<br/><br/>  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a<br/>facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application<br/>that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the<br/>facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified<br/>version:<br/><br/>   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to<br/>   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the<br/>   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs<br/>   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or<br/><br/>   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of<br/>   this License applicable to that copy.<br/><br/>  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.<br/><br/>  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from<br/>a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object<br/>code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated<br/>material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure<br/>layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates<br/>(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:<br/><br/>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the<br/>   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br/>   covered by this License.<br/><br/>   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br/>   document.<br/><br/>  4. Combined Works.<br/><br/>  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,<br/>taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the<br/>portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse<br/>engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of<br/>the following:<br/><br/>   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that<br/>   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are<br/>   covered by this License.<br/><br/>   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license<br/>   document.<br/><br/>   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during<br/>   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among<br/>   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the<br/>   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.<br/><br/>   d) Do one of the following:<br/><br/>       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this<br/>       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form<br/>       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to<br/>       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of<br/>       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the<br/>       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying<br/>       Corresponding Source.<br/><br/>       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br/>       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time<br/>       a copy of the Library already present on the user&#39;s computer<br/>       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version<br/>       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked<br/>       Version.<br/><br/>   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise<br/>   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the<br/>   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is<br/>   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the<br/>   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the<br/>   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If<br/>   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany<br/>   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application<br/>   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation<br/>   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL<br/>   for conveying Corresponding Source.)<br/><br/>  5. Combined Libraries.<br/><br/>  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br/>Library side by side in a single library together with other library<br/>facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this<br/>License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your<br/>choice, if you do both of the following:<br/><br/>   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based<br/>   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,<br/>   conveyed under the terms of this License.<br/><br/>   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it<br/>   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the<br/>   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br/><br/>  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.<br/><br/>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br/>of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new<br/>versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may<br/>differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br/><br/>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the<br/>Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version<br/>of the GNU Lesser General Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;<br/>applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br/>conditions either of that published version or of any later version<br/>published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you<br/>received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser<br/>General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser<br/>General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br/><br/>  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide<br/>whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall<br/>apply, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of any version is<br/>permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the<br/>Library.</div></div>
