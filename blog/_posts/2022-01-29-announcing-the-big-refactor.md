After letting Ronin sit for sometime without adding new features or releasing
new versions, I decided it was time for a Big Refactor. There is still a lot of
useful features and code in Ronin, the code just needs to be brought up to date
and those features be better exposed to end-user. A refactor and re-organization
will also allow for the rapid development of newer ronin libraries and tools.

## High-Level Plan

* [x] Bring repositories up to date with current Ruby best practices.
  * [x] Require ruby >= 2.7.0.
  * [x] Set `.ruby-version` to `ruby-3.0`.
  * [x] Use keyword arguments.
  * [x] Rename all `extensions/` directories to `core_ext/`.
  * [x] Replace TravisCI with [GitHub Actions].
  * [x] Rename `master` branches to `main`.
  * [x] Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
  * [x] Setup [rubocop] style checker.
  * [x] Opt-in to [rubygems.org MFA requirement].
* [x] Split larger libraries apart into smaller more manageable libraries.
  - Tier 1: ronin gems that only provide commands (ex: the main [ronin] gem).
  - Tier 2: `ronin-*` gems that also contain commands and some library code
    (ex: [ronin-db]).
  - Tier 3: `ronin-*` gems that only contain library code (ex:
    `ronin-web-server`).
* [x] Change the licenses of all libraries from GPLv3 to LGPLv3; excluding
      Tier 1 libraries.
* [x] Avoid excessive meta-programming in favor of simple Plain-Old-Ruby-Objects
     (PORO).
* [x] Add more commands to each `ronin-` library to better expose the APIs for
  non-Ruby-programmers.
* [x] Standardize on using the [command_kit] gem for all things CLI.
* [x] Store all user data and configuration in [XDG directories] \(`~/.config/`,
  `~/.cache/`, `~/.local/share/`\) (WIP).
* [x] Create a [ronin-core] library for reusable internal library code.
* [x] Create a [ronin-repos] library for handling 3rd-party Git repositories of
     additional code and data.
* [x] Extract database models from [ronin] into [ronin-db]. Refactor to use
      [ActiveRecord].
* [x] Extract and refactor the [ronin-fuzzer] library from [ronin-support].
* [x] Extract and refactor [ronin-web-server], [ronin-web-spider], and
      [ronin-web-user_agents] libraries from [ronin-web].
* [x] Replace [ronin-php] with a new [ronin-vuln] library.
* [x] Extract and refactor [ronin-payloads], [ronin-post_ex],
      [ronin-agent-node], [ronin-agent-php], and [ronin-agent-ruby], libraries
      from [ronin-exploits].
* [ ] Create a [ronin-c2] library for communicating with various agents and
      payloads.
* [x] Deprecate the `ronin-gen` gem and command, in favor of adding a `gen` or
      `new` subcommand for generating new boilerplate files or directories.

Below are the links to the individual GitHub issues for each library. You will
notice that nearly half of the issues are already checked. That is because they
have already been completed prior to publishing this blog post. We are already
past the half-way mark!

## The Future

After The Big Refactor is completed, I have plans to create additional new
Ronin libraries and tools for various tasks. This refactoring and re-organizing
of the dependencies should make the creation of new Ronin libraries and tools
much easier.

Here are some ideas:

* `ronin-nmap` - allow automating [nmap] and importing scan files into
 [ronin-db].
* `ronin-masscan` - allow automating [masscan] and importing scan files into
  [ronin-db].
* `ronin-amass` - allow automating [amass] and importing scan files into
  [ronin-db].
* `ronin-nvd` - imports [NVD JSON feeds] and CVE data into [ronin-db].
* `ronin-wordlists` - a library for downloading and managing wordlists.
* `ronin-wordlist-builder` - a library for building wordlists from various
  sources.
* `ronin-ncrack` - allow automating `ncrack` and using `ronin-wordlists`.
* `ronin-brute` - a collection of credential bruteforcers using
  `ronin-wordlists`.
* `ronin-recon` - an extendable recon engine, that can also load custom
  rules.
* `ronin-scanner` - an extendable scanner that can load custom rules.
* `ronin-hub` - a web application to provides a web interface to all major
  ronin libraries and exposes the [ronin-db].
